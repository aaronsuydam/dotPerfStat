# dotPerfStat
dotPerfStat is a .NET library that exposes access to hardware performance counters through a logical, consistent, and cross-platform abstraction.

### Important Note
This project is currently a hobby undertaking. I've used GenAI tools to help with some of the more platform-specific code, especially on macOS. I DO NOT offer this code as a production-ready (or even well-tested) library (read: if you break your stuff with this code, it's your own fault). 

That said, the purpose of this project is for me to learn. I've open-sourced the code because I believe in sharing useful tools, which is what I hope this becomes. If you find it useful or helpful, by all means use it! I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. File an issue and I'll respond when I can.
