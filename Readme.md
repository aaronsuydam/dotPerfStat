dotPerfStat is a .NET library that exposes access to hardware performance counters through a logical, consistent, and cross-platform abstraction.

### Disclosure
This project is currently a hobby undertaking by me (@aaronsuydam) and is for the purposes of my learning. I've used GenAI tools to help with some of the more platform-specific code, especially on macOS. I DO NOT offer this code as a production-ready (or even well-tested) library (read: if you break your stuff with this code, it's your own fault). 

That said, the purpose of this project is for me to learn. If you would also like to use it for that purpose, please, by all means, do so. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions for improvement. File an issue and I'll respond when I can.
